[USAGE: convert_vts_ascii2binary2.py]

1) Converting a single file

pvpython convert_vts_ascii2binary2.py -f ./Timestep_000003/subdomain-FallingBlock3D_temperature_step000003-mesh-p000003.vts

2) Converting a set of files in one place

pvpython convert_vts_ascii2binary2.py -p subdomain-FallingBlock3D_temperature_step000003-

NOTE: Don't specify the full path. This is a design flaw and will be revised later.
If you don't like this, or the file names don't have the timestep to identify them from data obtained from a different time step,
alternatively, you can copy the script into the directory you wish to convert and do something like

pvpython convert_vts_ascii2binary2.py -p subdomain-FallingBlock3D_temperature_

3) Converting a set of files living in multiple directories

pvpython convert_vts_ascii2binary2.py -d ./Timestep_ -p subdomain-FallingBlock3D_temperature

Note that adding the option 
  -r True 
will remove the files *_ascii_vts which created following conversion.
